1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,940
Now, in this section, we are going to use our data structure in real life project, so I'll show you

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,660
how to implement our data structure in real life project and how it helps us to make the things possible

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,720
that were not possible without error.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:21,090
So in this project, we are going to take the daily temperature from the user as an input and then we

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,870
are going to calculate the average of these temperature and then we will find out how many days is above

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,040
the average temperature.

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,290
Now our project will look like this.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,680
So here, as I mentioned, we are going to find a number of days above the average temperature.

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,240
So to find the number of days above the average temperature, we need to find out the average temperature.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,580
Then we need to check that reached these temperature is above the average temperature.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,490
Now, when we run, our program is going to look like this.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,480
First, it will ask how many days temperature we are going to input, because initial step is we need

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,780
to identify how many days temperature we are going to measure.

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,500
So, for example, for simplicity, if I put two over here and hit Enter is going to prompt me another

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,540
input question.

16
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,710
So it's going to ask the first high temperature.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,620
So for our kids, I'm going to put one for first these temperature.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,210
So as you see, we have said here, too.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,730
So that's what is going to ask secondees temperature over here.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,990
So how many days that we set over here, that number of days, temperatures will be asked from us over

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,290
here.

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,100
So for the second day, if I put, for example, two and then hit Enter is going to print out saying

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,320
that the average temperature is one point five and one, these temperature is above the average temperature.

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,830
So if you look at this example over here, you see that secondees temperature is above the average temperature

25
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,840
because average temperature is one point five.

26
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,100
So we are going to implement this project using our data structure.

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,480
Now, let's see how this is working in practice.

28
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,310
So by the end of this section, you will be able to make a program like this.

29
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,750
So in this case, if you run our program, you will see that the first thing that it does, it ask how

30
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,570
many days temperature in this case, if I put three over here, hit enter, you'll see that it is ask

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,080
the once high temperature, for example, if I put over here 10 and hit enter, it's going to ask the

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,660
high temperature for day two.

33
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,060
I'm going to put 20, then hit enter.

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,120
It will ask the three high temperature.

35
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,530
So for the three I'm going to put 15 and hit enter.

36
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,580
So after finding it you see that it returns.

37
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,870
US average temperature is 15 and one day's temperature is above average.

38
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,100
So in this case, secondees temperature is 24, which is above average.

39
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,420
So it's returning like this.

40
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,240
Now, by the end of this section, you will be able to make a project like this using our data structure.

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,850
So let's continue to implement our project.
