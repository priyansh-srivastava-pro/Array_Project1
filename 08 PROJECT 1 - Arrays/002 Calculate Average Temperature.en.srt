1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,000
So as I mentioned before, our project is consists of two parts.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:09,240
So first, we need to find the average temperature, then we need to find out how many days is above

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,540
the average temperature.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,760
Now, in this case, we can find the average temperature without using a radiator structure.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,790
So let's see, how can we implement it without using a radiator structure?

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,130
Then we will find out how our data structure makes things possible that we're not impossible before.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,710
So in this case, as I said before, the first thing that I am going to do, I need to get input from

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,230
a user.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,020
So in Java, to get input from user, we can use this scanner.

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,760
So by using scanner class, we can get the values from the console and use it in our program.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,470
So in this case, what I'm going to do, the first thing that I'm going to do, I'm going to create

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,200
an instance of this kind of class.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,170
So to use, Carol, because you need to then inside this main method, I'm going to implement our project.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,770
So the first thing that I'm going to do, I'm going to initialize scanner class console.

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,830
So I will name it.

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,890
Console is equal to a new scanner.

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,530
So inside this one is going to be system.

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,430
So it is line of code.

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,440
We are initializing our scanner class.

20
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,550
So then after realizing this, I need to print out message to ask from the user how many days temperature

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,570
we are going to use.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,910
So in this case, I need to talk message to the council so we know that in Java to print out message

23
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,940
to the council, we are using print method.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,830
So I'm going to call system, not out of print.

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,750
So inside print statement, I'm going to ask how many days temperature.

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,390
Then after doing so, I'm going to get the number of days.

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,330
So a story in an integer variable.

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,270
So I'm going to create integer variable numbers so it will get input from the console.

29
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,170
So to get input from the console, I'm going to put console.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,260
So this is kind of a class over here console the next end.

31
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,650
So in this case, it's going to be integer number.

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,850
So that's why I'm putting it over here.

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,260
So after getting them, I need to calculate the some of them and then using a number of days, we are

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,220
going to calculate the average of these days.

35
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,060
So we know that to calculate average, we need to take some of all these temperature and divide it by

36
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,690
number of days.

37
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,810
So in this case, I'm going to create another variable for some and initially it will be set to zero.

38
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,410
Then I'm going to loop through one until the number of days and get these temperature from the console.

39
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,940
So to do so, I'm going to write love like this.

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,300
So for print I equal one.

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,890
So it will continue.

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,130
I was an equal to this, so we need to get all the temperature.

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,920
Then it will be increased by one.

44
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,200
So inside this loop, I'm going to print out to the console asking the day's temperatures.

45
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,640
So I'll just copy this code from here and put it inside this room so I will change the message inside

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,070
this one.

47
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:04,800
So as you remember, the first thing was they saw here, which is temperature is going to be a high

48
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,560
class item.

49
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,530
Then one more time they are going to cocounsel next it to get the integer variable from the console

50
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,760
and added to the somebody below here.

51
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,120
So next variable will be comes out next.

52
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,490
And then we are going to add it to some some class will be next.

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,400
So it is called over here.

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,820
We are getting the day's temperature from the console and adding them to the sun variable or here.

55
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,190
So it depends on the number of days we have inserted over here.

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,740
So if you have a certain number of days, for example, two is going to ask two days temperature over

57
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,060
here.

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,830
So we are going to add it to the sun variable over here.

59
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,750
Now, after adding it, we need to calculate the average temperature.

60
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,260
So average temperature will be double data types.

61
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,530
So I'm going to create the average variable and calculate the average temperature.

62
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,340
So to calculate average temperature, we are going to take some divided by number of days.

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,800
Then after calculating this, we are going to print out to the council average temperature.

64
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,130
So it's going to be like this.

65
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,640
So here you need it to be double.

66
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,900
So here I am going to print out to the council.

67
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,460
I just need to put one space to the council.

68
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,130
So that's why I put Winterland first.

69
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,150
Then I'm going to print out to the council this one.

70
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,580
So print one.

71
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,880
It's going to be averaged ten plus average.

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,730
Now it is we have concluded a calculation of average temperature.

73
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,250
So if you run our code, you will see that the first thing that it does, it ask a number of days temperature.

74
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,950
So this line of code is executed over here and it comes over here to wait for the next line of code.

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,350
So we need to input number of days, for example, for simplicity.

76
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,510
If I put two over here and hit enter.

77
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,210
So you see that it continues to the inside of this loop over here in which it's asking, did they want

78
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,010
high temperature?

79
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,910
So if I put over here 10.

80
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,180
Hit enter, it's looping again, this loop over here and asking for the next day's temperatures for

81
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,740
next day's temperature.

82
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,540
I'm going to put 20 and hit enter is going to print out to the console.

83
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,100
Average temperature is 15.

84
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,080
Now, everything works over here smoothly and we have not used our data structure.

85
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,170
But the question over here is, how do you count how many days were above the average?

86
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,430
So we could try to incorporate it inside this loop over here, but it won't work.

87
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,490
The problem is you cannot figure out the average until you have gone through all of the data.

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,090
This means that you need to make a second pass through the data to figure out how many days were average

89
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,700
temperatures.

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,430
So after getting all these temperature, we are calculating the average temperature.

91
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:52,830
Then one more time we need to loop through these days of temperature and find out which these temperature

92
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,820
is above the average temperature now inside this loop.

93
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,220
We cannot do it because we have to look through all these temperature.

94
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,300
Then we can calculate the average temperature.

95
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:09,270
So this means that we cannot do it using of class because a scanner class has no reset option that allows

96
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,720
you to see the data.

97
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,940
Second time you would have to prompt the user, enter temperature a second time so we can use kind of

98
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,490
class to prompt the user to enter the temperature a second time.

99
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,820
But this will be very silly because in professional programs we can only ask data from a user one time

100
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,630
and use it several times in our code.

101
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,920
So that's why we cannot ask using kind of a second time, because by mistake they can enter a different

102
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,460
data.

103
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,120
And actually no one wants to enter same information twice to the program.

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,850
So how can we solve this problem?

105
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,670
Fortunately, we can solve this problem with the array as the user enters the number.

106
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,690
We can compute to come to some and we can save this data in our area.

107
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,210
So then after saving that, we can make second pass through the array in which we have saved all this

108
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,550
temperature and find out the average temperature.

109
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,530
Now, in the next lecture, we are going to implement this logic in our program.
