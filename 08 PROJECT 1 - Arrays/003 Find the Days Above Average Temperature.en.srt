1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,030
Nine days later, we are going to implement a radiator structure in our program to calculate the number

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,750
of days that are above the average temperature.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,040
So I'm going to change this code to use our data structure in this court.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,050
So as we said before, without using our data structure, we cannot calculate the number of days above

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,980
the average temperature.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,400
So that's why we are going to use our data structure.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,590
So it is you will understand how a rate data structure is very useful in cases like this.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,270
Now, as we said before, the first thing that we are going to do, we are getting the input from the

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,680
user.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,020
So here we are going to use Kanakas.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,550
So I'm not going to touch this part of code over here.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,670
Then in the next line of code, we are printing out to the council and asking the number of days from

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,130
the user.

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,400
So this will remain same and this part also will remain same.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,200
We are getting the number of days and save it to the days variable.

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:59,850
Now here after this one, I'm going to create a new array over here which will store each day's temperature.

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,210
So here the array type will be integer.

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:09,200
So I'm going to declare it like this and then there will be temps which would restore the temperatures.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,590
Then it's going to be initialized like this.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,090
Now, you might be interested how many cells will be in this area.

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,800
So it's going to be a number of days because we will have only this number of temperatures in our area.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,320
That's why we have initialise early with this sizable number of days.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,820
So after initializing this temporary over here, we are going to record the temperatures for each day

24
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,310
and save them in this area over here.

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,830
And then when we are seeing them parallel, we are going to find the average temperature.

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,090
So here I'm going to comment something like this, record temperature and find the average.

27
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,480
So by collecting this, you will know that this section is blown to recording the temperatures and finding

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,850
the average.

29
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,800
So here I am not going to touch this variable over here because we are saving the some of the temperatures

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,600
in this variable.

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,270
So inside the loop, we are going to ask from a user to enter the each day's temperature.

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,220
So while entering it this time, I'm not going to save it in this next variable over here.

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,340
I'm going to save them in the temps over here.

34
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,080
So here is going to be like this.

35
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,270
We are going to put like this then based on this, we are going to calculate the sum of temperature.

36
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,560
So each time a user enters the data, it saves in this temperature area over here.

37
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,200
Interesting moment over here that we know that array index starts from zero.

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,250
But here we put it starts from day one.

39
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:38,460
So this means that we need to change the loop to start from the zero and it continues until the number

40
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:38,900
of days.

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,500
So the number of days will not be included over here because we are starting from zero.

42
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:49,500
But if you do so and printing out to the council is going to ask from a user, they rose High-temperature

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:49,870
first.

44
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,990
So to prevent this misunderstanding, I'm going to put over here I plus one.

45
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,950
So in this case, it's going to be a plus one.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,150
So it will be inside passes for that.

47
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,540
This is different from everything.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,480
So from user, it will ask the wants temperature, but in the array it will store these days once temperature

49
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,690
at the index of zero.

50
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,780
Then you calculate the sum of these temperatures over here.

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,710
So with this, we are calculating the sum of temperatures.

52
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,440
Then inside this average variable, we are going to calculate the average temperature for everything

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,610
over here remains same.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,700
So after finding the average temperature, we need to find out the number of days that are above the

55
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,910
average temperature.

56
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,710
So that's where I'm going to comment over here, can't they?

57
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,120
Above average.

58
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,390
Now, how can we do that?

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,960
Now, you've said that we are saving all temperatures in this area over here.

60
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,430
So if you are saving all temperatures in this area, we can look through this area and finding out the

61
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,440
number of days that are above the average because we have already calculate the average and we have

62
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,620
the all this temperature inside this temperature area.

63
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,050
So this means that by looking through this area, we can compare that if the temperature is above the

64
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,930
average or so for this first I'm going to create a variable above and initially it will set to zero

65
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,350
because we know it's zero number of days are greater than the average temperature.

66
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,810
So then we look through this area over here.

67
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:21,720
So I'm going to write a book like this and I will start from zero because starts from the index of zero

68
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:28,460
and it will continue onto the length of arrays for the length of a range of will be calculated by using.

69
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,290
And each time it will increase by one.

70
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:39,300
So inside this loop, I'm going to write if conditions like this, if temps I is greater than average,

71
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,470
then in this case I'm going to increase this above variable by one.

72
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,940
So it's going to increase by one and it will continue until we have checked all these temperatures over

73
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,230
here.

74
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,970
Then at the end, I'm going to print out the average temperature, then the number of days that are

75
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,700
greater than the average temperature.

76
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,700
So I'm going to copy.

77
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,200
Print statement and put it over here, and I'm going to change it like this.

78
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,710
They average every so here I am going to put a ball.

79
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,160
So with this, we have completed our project.

80
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,110
So basically what we are doing over here is we are taking the number of days from the user.

81
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:23,800
And based on this variable nowadays over here, they are asking the user if these temperatures so while

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,140
a user enters the temperature, they are saving them.

83
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,250
This array over here.

84
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,210
Then based on this one, we are calculating the sum of these temperatures.

85
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,450
And then based on this one, we are calculating the average temperature using number of days.

86
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:42,400
Then after calculating the average temperature one more time via looping through the array and finding

87
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,770
out how many days temperature is above the average temperature.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,280
So as we said before, without using our data structure, we cannot calculate the number of days that

89
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,650
are above the average temperature because we need to save this data in any data structure.

90
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,220
So in this case, we are saving it in the array.

91
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,960
Now, if we run our code, you will see that first it asks number of days temperature.

92
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,200
So here I'm going to put three, then I'm going to insert five for the first day's high temperature

93
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,120
for the second day, high temperature.

94
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,970
I'm going to insert 20 for the 30 days.

95
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,220
High temperature, I'm going to insert twenty five.

96
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,220
So if I heat enter, you see that two days temperature is above the average and the average temperature

97
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,940
is 16.

98
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,640
So they twos and threes temperatures are above the average temperature.

99
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,340
So with this, we have come to the end of this letter.

100
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,980
So hopefully everything is clear about how can we implement our data structure in real life project.

101
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,980
So see you in the next lecture.
